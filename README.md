# Shader Practice

Just a repo where I intend to upload miscellaneous shader-related practice.

### Special Thanks
- Bruno Simon's [three.js journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) courses.
  - He's got great courses on three.js, and I've learned a lot from them.
- "wtshm"'s [r3f-curl-flow](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/admiring-christian-nnxq97) implementation on CodeSandbox.
  - This was a great reference for figuring out how to implement GPGPU in React Three Fiber.
